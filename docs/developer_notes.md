# Developer Notes

This file contains notes for contributors and maintainers.

- Follow the `pyproject.toml` for packaging decisions.
- Use `examples/text2sql_demo.py` as the starting point for demonstrations.
- The `src/text2sql/agents` package will hold LangGraph flows.
- The `src/text2sql/retrieval` package will contain the LlamaIndex connector.

Implementation tasks will be broken into issues and PRs.
